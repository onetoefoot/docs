# Introduction

Based on work that was being done we were looking for a way to make things easier for the employees. Since robots were out of the question because of the cost we decided that some how we get users to us scanning to pull data from bar codes and then have that upload to a website.

This package was designed to do only enough work to help the employee be more accurate with data collection.

The only issue was getting the scanning to work with a simple smart phone or pad. We found that the bar codes that need to be scanned are to small for the software to recognize. We didn't do extensive testing with it but that is where we left off.

This package is the work of on-boarding and off-loading the data.
